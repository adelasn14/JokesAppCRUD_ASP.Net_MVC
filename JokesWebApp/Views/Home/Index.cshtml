    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Jokes Web App</h1>
    <p>This a jokes web app, my first attempt project on learning ASP.Net Core MVC. Followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEjDD8mWYg&pp=ugMICgJpZBABGAHKBRVhc3AubmV0IHNoYWQgZnJlZWNvZGU%3D">tutorial video from Freecodecamp by Shad Sluiter on Youtube.</a> 
       Learned on using Identity as user authorization, add new migrations and updating the database, that mac doesnt have built-in SQL-Server so i have to use DB Browser for SQLite and NuGet Package Manager Console.</p>
